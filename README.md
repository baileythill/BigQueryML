<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Big Query ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs)

The data science world as we know it is obsessed with building the most innovative and effective ML models. Machine learning on large datasets requires extensive programming and knowledge of ML frameworks. These requirements restrict solution development to a very small set of people.Many companies couldnâ€™t afford data scientists with such a level of expertise but have a need to build models to drive their business forward. 

BigQuery ML democratizes machine learning by letting SQL practitioners build models using existing SQL tools and skills.Companies can use their data analysts who understand the data but have limited knowledge and programming expertise.

Our project will walk you through the project on how to use this amazing tool using a sample NCAA Basketball dataset.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

A working knowledge of database querying skills.

### Installation

To get started with BigQueryML 

1. Create a free trial account with Google Cloud:- [Create Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?_ga=2.204501072.151589388.1651269401-1400319142.1646283033)

2. In the google console page:- [Create a Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. [Make sure billing is enabled.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled)

4. [Ensure that the API is enabled.](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigquery&_ga=2.3380720.151589388.1651269401-1400319142.1646283033)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage


Step one: Create your dataset
The first step is to create a BigQuery dataset to store your model. To create your dataset, follow these steps:
1. In the Cloud Console, go to the BigQuery page.
     Go to the BigQuery page
1. In the navigation panel, in the Resources section, click your project name.
1. On the right side, in the details panel, click Create dataset.Create dataset. ![Create a Dataset](assets/create-dataset.png)
1. On the Create dataset page, for Dataset ID, enter census.
1. Leave all of the other default settings in place and click Create dataset.


Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.
